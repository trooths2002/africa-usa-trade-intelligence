     * Run whether user is logged on or not: Checked
   - Triggers Tab:
     * New Trigger: Daily at 2:00 AM
   - Actions Tab:
     * New Action:
       - Program/script: python
       - Add arguments: scripts/scheduled_data_collection.py
       - Start in: [Your project directory]
   - Conditions Tab:
     * Wake the computer to run this task: Checked
   - Settings Tab:
     * Allow task to be run on demand: Checked

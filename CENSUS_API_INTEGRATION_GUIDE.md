# U.S. Census Bureau API Integration Guide
## For Africa-USA Agriculture Trade Intelligence Platform

This guide explains how to use the U.S. Census Bureau API integration in your FREE WORLD TRADE project to access real-time trade data for Africa-USA agricultural trade.

## üìã Overview

The U.S. Census Bureau provides free access to comprehensive international trade data through their API. This integration allows you to:

- Track U.S. agricultural exports to African countries
- Monitor U.S. agricultural imports from African countries
- Analyze trade trends and identify opportunities
- Support arbitrage detection and market intelligence

```
- Track what the U.S. is exporting to African countries
- Useful for identifying market gaps and opportunities

### 2. Monthly U.S. Imports by Harmonized System (HS) Code
```
https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/intltrade/imports/hs

## üõ† Implementation Examples

### Python Function to Get Trade Data

```python
import requests

def get_census_trade_data(trade_type="imports", year="2023", month="12", country_code=None, commodity_code=None):
    """Get trade data from U.S. Census Bureau API"""
    try:
        # Select appropriate endpoint
        if trade_type == "exports":
            endpoint = "https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/intltrade/exports/hs"
            params = {
                "get": "E_COMMODITY,E_COMMODITY_LDESC,ALL_VAL_MO,ALL_VAL_YR",
                "YEAR": year,
                "MONTH": month
            }
            if commodity_code:
                params["E_COMMODITY"] = commodity_code
        else:
            endpoint = "https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/intltrade/imports/hs"
            params = {
                "get": "CTY_CODE,CTY_NAME,GEN_VAL_MO,CON_VAL_MO,E_COMMODITY,E_COMMODITY_LDESC",
                "YEAR": year,
                "MONTH": month
            }
            if country_code:
                params["CTY_CODE"] = country_code
            if commodity_code:
                params["E_COMMODITY"] = commodity_code
        
        response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()
        else:
            return None
    except:
        return None

# Example usage:
# Get coffee imports from Ghana
coffee_data = get_census_trade_data("imports", "2023", "12", country_code="7490", commodity_code="0901")
```

## üîß Testing the Integration

To test the API integration:

1. Run the test script:
   ```
   python scripts/test_census_api.py
   ```

2. Check the dashboard for real-time data:
   ```
   streamlit run src/web_app/dashboard/main.py
   ```

3. Verify that trade data is being displayed correctly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **No API Key Required**: The Census API works without an API key but has rate limits
2. **Rate Limiting**: Be respectful of API usage - implement delays between requests
3. **Data Availability**: Monthly data is typically available with a 1-2 month lag
4. **Free Service**: This is a completely free government service with no cost

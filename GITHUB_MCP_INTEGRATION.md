# GitHub MCP Server Integration for Africa-USA Trade Intelligence Platform

## Overview
This document describes how the GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration works for the Africa-USA Trade Intelligence Platform. The integration ensures that the platform remains productive, automated, and continuously updated with real-time market intelligence.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (ci-cd.yml)
- **Purpose**: Continuous integration and deployment
- **Triggers**: Push to main branch, pull requests
- **Functions**:
  - Tests the API server and data collection modules
  - Deploys the dashboard to Streamlit Cloud
  - Runs health checks on all services

### 2. MCP Server Automation (mcp-server.yml)
- **Purpose**: Automated market intelligence processing
- **Triggers**: Scheduled daily at 09:00 UTC, manual trigger
- **Functions**:
  - Runs the MCP intelligence server
  - Performs market analysis
  - Identifies arbitrage opportunities
  - Updates documentation with daily reports

### 3. Automated Data Collection (data-collection.yml)
- **Purpose**: Regular data collection from free APIs
- **Triggers**: Every 6 hours, manual trigger
- **Functions**:
  - Collects Census trade data
  - Gathers commodity prices
  - Retrieves exchange rates
  - Updates data repository

### 4. GitHub MCP Server Integration (github-mcp-server.yml)
- **Purpose**: Ensures proper MCP server integration with GitHub
- **Triggers**: Push to main branch, pull requests, manual trigger
- **Functions**:
  - Tests MCP server connection
  - Validates MCP tools
  - Tests GitHub integration
  - Deploys MCP server when needed

## MCP Server Components

### Intelligence Server (src/intelligence/server.py)
The MCP intelligence server provides the following capabilities:
- Market analysis and trend identification
- Arbitrage opportunity detection
- Supplier and buyer intelligence
- Expert content generation for social media

### API Gateway (src/api/main.py)
The API gateway serves as the interface between the dashboard and the MCP server:
- Provides RESTful endpoints for data access
- Implements caching for performance
- Handles health monitoring

### Data Collection (src/data/collector.py)
Automated data collection from free APIs:
- U.S. Census Bureau trade data
- World Bank commodity prices
- Exchange rate information
- Trade news feeds

## Automation Productivity Features

### 1. Scheduled Market Analysis
- Daily market analysis runs automatically
- Arbitrage opportunities are identified and documented
- Supplier and buyer intelligence is updated

### 2. Continuous Data Collection
- Trade data is collected every 6 hours
- Commodity prices are updated regularly
- Exchange rates are monitored continuously

### 3. Automated Reporting
- Daily reports are generated and committed to the repository
- Data collection logs are maintained
- Deployment information is tracked

### 4. Health Monitoring
- API server health is checked regularly
- Dashboard accessibility is monitored
- Service performance is tracked

## GitHub Integration Benefits

### 1. Zero-Cost Operation
- All automation runs on GitHub's free tier
- No paid services or premium features required
- Efficient resource utilization

### 2. Continuous Updates

- Issues can be identified and resolved quickly

## How to Monitor Automation

### 1. GitHub Actions Tab
- View workflow runs and their status
- Check logs for any errors or issues
- Monitor execution times and performance

### 2. Repository Commits
- Daily reports are committed to the repository
- Data collection logs track information gathering
- Deployment information shows system status

### 3. GitHub Issues
- Report any problems or issues
- Request new features or enhancements
- Track ongoing work and improvements

## Best Practices for Maintaining Productivity

### 1. Regular Monitoring
- Check GitHub Actions for failed workflows
- Review daily reports for market insights
- Monitor data collection logs for completeness

### 2. Continuous Improvement
- Add new data sources as they become available
- Enhance market analysis algorithms
- Improve automation workflows

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Keep documentation current with changes
- Add new features to implementation guides
- Update user instructions as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Workflow Failures**: Check logs for error messages and fix underlying issues
2. **Data Collection Problems**: Verify API endpoints and update as needed
3. **MCP Server Issues**: Ensure all tools are properly defined and accessible

### Resolution Steps
1. Review GitHub Actions logs for detailed error information
2. Check the repository for recent changes that might have caused issues
3. Test components locally before pushing updates
4. Use manual workflow triggers to test fixes

This GitHub MCP server integration ensures that the Africa-USA Trade Intelligence Platform remains productive, automated, and continuously updated with real-time market intelligence while operating at zero cost.

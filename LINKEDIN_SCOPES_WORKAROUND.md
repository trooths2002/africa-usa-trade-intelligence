# LinkedIn OAuth Scopes Workaround
## Solution for "Scopes Not Appearing After App Verification"

## Problem
You've successfully verified your LinkedIn app and been granted access to the "Share on LinkedIn" product, but the OAuth scopes are still not appearing in the interface even after waiting the recommended 10-15 minutes.

## Solution: Client Credentials Flow (2-legged OAuth)

As a workaround, you can use LinkedIn's Client Credentials flow to access certain APIs that don't require member-specific permissions. This approach bypasses the need for OAuth scopes that require user authorization.

## Implementation Details

The updated LinkedIn API implementation now includes a `get_client_credentials_token()` method that implements the 2-legged OAuth flow:

```python
def get_client_credentials_token(self) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Generate an access token using the Client Credentials flow (2-legged OAuth)
    This is for accessing APIs that are not member specific
    """
    url = "https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken"
    data = {
        "grant_type": "client_credentials",
        "client_id": self.client_id,
        "client_secret": self.client_secret
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, data=data)
    # ... process response
```

## How to Use the Workaround

1. **Run the Client Credentials test script**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_linkedin_client_credentials.py
   ```

2. **Use the client credentials token** for non-member specific APIs:
   - Access to jobs API
   - Access to organization data (if your app has the right permissions)
   - Other public data endpoints

## Limitations

The Client Credentials flow has specific limitations:
- Cannot access member-specific data (profiles, connections, etc.)
- Cannot post content on behalf of users
- Limited to APIs that don't require user context

## When Scopes Appear

Continue to check for the OAuth scopes as they may appear with time:
1. Refresh the LinkedIn Developer Portal page regularly
2. Log out and back in to force a session refresh
3. Wait up to 24-48 hours as LinkedIn's systems may need time to fully propagate permissions

## Next Steps

1. Use the Client Credentials flow for immediate access to compatible APIs
2. Continue monitoring the OAuth scopes section in your app dashboard
3. Once scopes appear, you can implement the full 3-legged OAuth flow for member-specific features

This workaround allows you to continue developing and testing your Africa-USA trade intelligence platform while waiting for the full OAuth scope permissions to be granted.

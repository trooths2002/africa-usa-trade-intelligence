# ü§ñ Automated Pipeline Overview - Africa-USA Trade Intelligence Platform

This document explains how the automated pipeline works and provides next steps to supply secrets and finish LinkedIn connector setup.

## üîÑ How the Automation Pipeline Works

The Africa-USA Trade Intelligence Platform now features a comprehensive automation pipeline that runs 24/7 to identify trade opportunities and maintain system health.

### 1. Scheduled Automation (Hourly)

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/mcp-automation.yml`

Every hour, the system automatically:

1. **üîç Runs Phase 0 Quick Checks**:
   - Tests MCP server connectivity
   - Verifies memory server availability
   - Checks external data sources (US Census, World Bank, Exchange Rates)
   - Simulates opportunity detection

2. **üìä Generates Intelligence**:
   - Scans for arbitrage opportunities
   - Analyzes market trends
   - Identifies supplier-buyer matches
   - Calculates commission potentials

3. **üìß Sends Email Summary**:
   - System health status
   - Number of opportunities found
   - Data source availability
   - Performance metrics
   - Detailed logs attached

4. **üíæ Archives Results**:
   - Uploads scan logs as GitHub artifacts
   - Maintains historical performance data
   - Stores opportunity data for dashboard

### 2. Continuous Deployment (Push-Triggered)

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy_render.yml`

When code is pushed to main branch:

1. **üê≥ Builds Docker Images**:
   - Market Intelligence Server container
   - Streamlit Dashboard container
   - Optimized for production deployment

2. **üì§ Pushes to Docker Hub** (if configured):
   - Tagged with commit SHA and branch
   - Cached builds for faster deployments
   - Multi-platform support

3. **üöÄ Deploys to Render**:
   - Triggers deployment via Render API
   - Updates both services automatically
   - Zero-downtime deployments

4. **üì¨ Notifies Success/Failure**:
   - Email notifications for deployment status
   - Links to workflow logs
   - Service health confirmations

### 3. Local Development Stack

**File**: `docker-compose.yml`

For local development and testing:

```bash
# Start full stack
docker-compose up -d

# Services available:
# Dashboard: http://localhost:8501
# Market Intelligence: http://localhost:8000  
# Memory Server: http://localhost:3001
```

## üîê Required Secrets Configuration

### Step 1: Essential Secrets (Start Here)

Add these secrets to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions:

```
NOTIFY_EMAIL_TO=your.email@domain.com
NOTIFY_EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your.email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
```

### Step 2: Docker Hub (For Production)

```
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN=your-dockerhub-access-token
```

### Step 3: Render Deployment (For Cloud Hosting)

```
RENDER_API_KEY=your-render-api-key
RENDER_SERVICE_ID=srv-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
RENDER_DASHBOARD_SERVICE_ID=srv-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 4: LinkedIn Integration (Manual Approval Required)

```
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=your-linkedin-client-id
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your-linkedin-client-secret
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: LinkedIn API access requires manual approval from LinkedIn. This can take 1-2 weeks.
